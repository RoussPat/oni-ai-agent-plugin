## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

1. ✅ **Keyboard input interference removed** - Spacebar should work normally
2. ✅ **Ctrl+Alt+A completely disabled** - No more input conflicts
3. ✅ **Proper UI integration** - AI button should appear in game's toolbar
4. ✅ **Console access alternatives** - Multiple keys to try

## 🔧 **Debug Access (For Troubleshooting)**

To access debug information:

1. **Create `debug_enable.txt` in game root folder**
2. **Press `BACKSPACE` in-game** to open debug tools
3. **Check log files** for mod messages:
   - Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/`
   - Look for files with timestamps
   - Search for "[AI Agent Plugin]" messages

## 🎮 **Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Basic Input Test
1. **Start Oxygen Not Included**
2. **Enable the AI Agent Plugin mod**
3. **Start a new game**
4. **Test basic controls:**
   - ✅ **Spacebar should pause/unpause** (no interference)
   - ✅ **Arrow keys should move camera**
   - ✅ **Mouse should work normally**
   - ✅ **All game controls should work**

### Step 2: UI Button Test
1. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for UI integration
2. **Look for AI button in the game's toolbar** (top-right area)
3. **The button should appear alongside:**
   - Time management buttons
   - Portal icon
   - Sandbox button (if enabled)
4. **Button should be green with "AI" text**

### Step 3: Button Functionality Test
1. **Click the AI button**
2. **Agent Control dialog should open**
3. **Test creating agents:**
   - Click "Create Hello World Agent"
   - Click "Create GPT Agent"
   - Check that agents appear in the list

### Step 4: Debug Information (if needed)
Check log files for these messages:
```
[AI Agent Plugin] Mod loaded: AIAgentPlugin v1.0.0
[AI Agent Plugin] GameClock initialized - AI Agent is ready
[AI Agent Plugin] Starting UI integration...
[AI Agent Plugin] UI integration attempt 1/20
[AI Agent Plugin] Found potential game canvas: [canvas name]
[AI Agent Plugin] Found potential button container: [container name]
[AI Agent Plugin] AI button created successfully in game UI!
[AI Agent Plugin] AI button clicked - opening agent control dialog
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### If Spacebar Still Doesn't Work
- The issue is NOT with our mod
- Check other mods or game settings
- Try restarting the game
- Verify game is not paused

### If AI Button Doesn't Appear
- Wait longer (up to 30 seconds)
- Check console for UI integration messages
- Try restarting the game
- Verify mod is enabled

### If Button Appears But Doesn't Work
- Click multiple times
- Check console for click messages
- Try restarting the game

### If Debug Tools Won't Open
- Make sure `debug_enable.txt` exists in game root folder
- Try pressing `BACKSPACE` key
- Check log files for mod messages instead

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Spacebar works** for pause/unpause  
✅ **All game controls work** normally  
✅ **AI button appears** in game toolbar  
✅ **Button is clickable** and opens dialog  
✅ **Agent creation works** in dialog  

## 📋 **Expected Behavior**

1. **No keyboard interference** - All game controls work normally
2. **AI button in toolbar** - Green button with "AI" text in top-right area
3. **Clickable button** - Opens Agent Control dialog when clicked
4. **Working dialog** - Can create and manage AI agents
5. **No Ctrl+Alt+A** - Keyboard shortcut completely disabled

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

If you can access log files, look for:
- UI integration attempts (1-20)
- Canvas and container detection
- Button creation success/failure
- Click event handling

The new system should be much more reliable and integrate properly with the game's UI! 🚀
